        <p>
           To train Izzy, you need to provide the CORRECTIONS to his CURRENT state when he is misbehaving. 
        </p>

         <p>
           When providing a control you will need to move the BLUE robot to the correct location and HOLD it there until the next frame.
           If Izzy keeps making the same mistake make sure to keep HOLDING the BLUE robot in the correct direction.
        </p>

        <p>
           Remember the task is to push objects around to get to the GOLDEN CIRCLE. Things Izzy might need help with are:
        
        </p>
        <ul>
           <li> PUSHING the objects to clear a PATH </li>
            <li>MOVING TOWARDS the GOLDEN CIRCLE </li>
           <li> CLOSING its GRIPPER before reaching the GOLDEN CIRCLE. </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
           NOTE: Izzy can only move so much from its current position, so you will not be able to move the BLUE robot farther than Izzy is able to move. 
        </p>
